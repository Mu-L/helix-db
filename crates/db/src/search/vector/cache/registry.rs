//! Descriptor-bound lifecycle registry for vector memory-cache generations.
//!
//! [`VectorCacheRegistry`] is the only owner of cache entries whose identity is
//! derived from a [`ValidatedVectorGenerationHandle`]. Each entry follows the
//! explicit `Vacant <-> Hydrating -> Ready -> Retiring -> Closed` lifecycle.
//! Any operation must hold a [`VectorCacheReadGuard`] while using its store;
//! retirement changes the entry to `Retiring`, rejects new guards, waits for
//! existing guards and hydration to finish, acquires the independent all-dirty
//! publication guard, clears the exact store, and only then reaches `Closed`.
//!
//! Every identity has one commit fence owned by the registry rather than by
//! its entry, so a storage commit is fenced even before the first hydration
//! creates the entry and even if the entry is replaced while the commit is in
//! flight. [`VectorCacheVisibility`] decides how a published store's hydration
//! sequence and that fence authorize a request snapshot.
//!
//! Closed entries deliberately remain registered until physical cleanup calls
//! [`VectorCacheRegistry::forget_closed`]. That tombstone prevents a concurrent
//! or stale background hydration from reopening a generation after retirement
//! but before its current-format rows have been deleted. The registry is
//! process-local disposable state and writes no database key or value.
