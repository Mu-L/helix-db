//! Row-preserving residual filter and node index membership contracts.

//! Both operators keep rows in input order with their paths, bindings, and
//! sacks. Rows that need a predicate are evaluated in bounded batches whose
//! stored records are read with one multi-get per batch instead of one serial
//! read per row.
//!
//! Index membership decides nodes from a set read from indexes and evaluates
//! a predicate only for rows the set cannot decide, plus the residual
//! conjuncts of nodes in the set. There is no row-count threshold: the first
//! node row that needs a decision resolves the set, once per request state,
//! and a resolved set is reused by later executions of the same plan in the
//! request, such as branch bodies that run once per parent row. Streams
//! without node rows never resolve it.
